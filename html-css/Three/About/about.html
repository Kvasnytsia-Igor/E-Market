        <h1>E-Market</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>
          An e-commerce website/app is a very famous project and it is in almost
          every full-stack developer's portfolio. This project is a very vast
          project and involves a lot of front-end, back-end as well as database
          knowledge. It is considered a major project and it takes a lot of hard
          work and time to make it. it posible either make an e-commerce
          site/app or try to clone an existing large-scale app/website like
          Amazon or Flipkart, etc.
        </p>
        <h3>The knowledge that I will gain from this project:</h3>
        <p>
          This project takes up a lot of time and energy. I will learn a lot
          about how the backend of this e-commerce website works and a lot about
          user security, authentication, etc. Managing a huge database with
          different categories of products and different catalogues will also be
          a challenge.
